Hi.

This is a repository of miscellaneous sourcemod stuff I've been tinkering with. 

**This repository contains miscellaneous code - from time to time code will be moved to a dedicated repository.  Check https://github.com/foobarhl?tab=repositories if you can't find something**

It's all in development and might be broken from time to time.  If it is, please report an issue.  

Documentation for plugins 'n stuff can be found from: https://github.com/foobarhl/sourcemod/wiki

That being said have at 'er.
